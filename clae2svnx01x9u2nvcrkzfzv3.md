# 11 Useful Firefox Add-ons to Enhance Your Browsing

I believe we can all agree that Firefox is among the top Linux browsers.

The icing on the cake is that you can improve your browsing experience by using some extensions! perhaps even sever Facebook? üòè

Let me give you some advice before I recommend some fantastic Firefox add-ons.

## Before installing a Firefox add-on, consider the following:

We all know that installing [browser extensions haphazardly can be very harmful.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chrome-extensions-with-14-million-installs-steal-browsing-data/) How can you tell if a browser extension is secure to use, then?

We concentrate on the Firefox marketplace since this article is about Firefox add-ons (the official place to get the add-ons).

Although nothing is completely secure or bug-free, there are a few things one can check:

- **[Add-on Permissions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions):** The ability to ‚ÄúAccess browser tabs,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccess browser activity while navigating,‚Äù and other permissions are needed by some add-ons. Take note of this and decide how comfortable you are with the use of permission.
- **Last updated date:** Even reputable extensions are occasionally not updated. This is fine, but it‚Äôs a big deal for things like password managers and ad blockers. _When using an add-on that is more than two months old, exercise caution._
- **Add-on Publisher:** Always check to see if the publisher of the add-on is a reputable person or has previously released a reliable add-on.
- **Starts, Reviews:** Although this doesn‚Äôt provide much assurance on its own, you can take this into account among other factors. You can also determine whether an item is sufficiently popular with users by focusing on the number of reviews.
- **[Add-on Badges](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-badges):** Look for the ‚ÄúRecommended‚Äù or ‚ÄúBy Firefox‚Äù badges; avoid adding extensions that have a warning icon or badge.

Having said that, let‚Äôs take a look at a few extensions that enhance your web browsing.


## 1. Bitwarden

![11 Useful Firefox Add-ons to Enhance Your Browsing Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwarden/brand/master/screenshots/apps-combo-logo.png)

### Key Feature:

- The recommended extension by Mozilla.
- 4.8 stars on average (out of more than 6000 reviews).

Everyone should use Bitwarden as their primary password manager. It supports free desktop, web, and mobile sync, secure note storage, password generation assistance, user information auto-fill, and much more. Additionally, [it is distributed under the GPL-3.0 License.](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) Who doesn‚Äôt adore open-source and free software?

Everything I would want in a password manager is present in Bitwarden. If you want to upgrade to its premium plan and not self-host it, it only costs $10. It's Firefox add-on comes highly recommended!

## 2. uBlock Origin

![11 Useful Firefox Add-ons to Enhance Your Browsing Experience](https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/238/238546.png?modified=1622132421)

### Key Feature:

- The recommended extension by Mozilla.
- 14,000+ reviews, 4.8-star rating on average.
- continually updated.

One of the most well-known and reliable Firefox ‚Äúad blocking‚Äù add-ons is uBlock Origin. Yes, it is primarily used for blocking ads, but given that its primary function is to block web browser elements, it can also block a wide variety of other things. Yes, there are advertisements, but there are also web trackers, cryptocurrency miners, pop-up windows, etc.

There is a purpose for its permissions, even though they might seem a little excessive. To evaluate each query and block any that appear harmful or pointless, the add-on needs permissions like ‚ÄúAccess browser activity during navigation‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccess your data for all websites.‚Äù

## 3. Facebook Container

### Key Feature:

- constructed by the Mozilla Firefox team
- has more than 3,500 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars.
- periodically updated

Despite how much everyone despises Facebook, very few people are willing to remove its tracking technologies from their websites. Mozilla then pulled a Thanos move, saying, ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù and developed this Firefox add-on.

As the name implies, Facebook is created in a separate container that has nothing to do with Docker. Everything involving Facebook takes place in this solitary space. This ultimately makes it more difficult for the social media behemoth to locate you.

## 4. Enhancer for YouTube

Would you prefer an open-source [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) substitute? Even though I have no issues with Grammarly, I enjoy and prefer using free and open-source software. The thesaurus that comes with LanguageTool is a great tool for checking grammar irregularities like spelling mistakes, using a different spelling (colour vs. colour), and words that are frequently confused (then vs. than).

This add-on has, in my experience using it, reliably operated on almost all text fields. There are no issues. The following are the two main features of this add-on:

- There are more than 25 supported languages. The list of supported languages is located at the bottom of the section titled ‚ÄúAbout this extension.‚Äù
- This add-on does not require registration!

## 6. Tranquillity Reader

Imagine that you are browsing an online article. On the top and bottom of the page, there are two banner ads. The entire right side is covered in ads. A video that is automatically playing is above the bottom advertisement banner. Your ad blocker is activated. However, the video keeps playing. Although the banners don‚Äôt contain advertisements, they still take up valuable screen space. Quite bothered?

Be less concerned. Here it is the Tranquility Reader Firefox add-on. The ‚Äúextra‚Äù elements that this extension removes include images, videos, advertisements, social media share buttons, etc. You get a simple user interface with just text so you can concentrate on reading.

The following statistics pertain to the Tranquility Reader add-on:

- The recommended extension by Mozilla.
- has a 4.6-star rating on average (with 200 reviews).
- Actively maintained but not frequently updated.

### Key Feature:

- respectable media upload privacy policies.

Images of a red Lamborghini are returned when you search for ‚ÄúRed Lamborghini‚Äù. But, what if you didn‚Äôt know what car it was? This add-on enables you to search for images by using the image rather than textual terms, and it displays related results or the image‚Äôs source.

You can select an image for a search in the following ways:

- Choose URL: This enables you to quickly click on an image that is shown on a website.
- To capture a portion of a web page for a reverse image search, use clipping software.
- Browse: Upload an existing image from the computer‚Äôs local drive (instead of the web page) (instead of the web page).

A very straightforward Firefox add-on is FireShot. You can use it to save the entire web page as a PDF file or a single, long image. Additionally, you can annotate (haha)! Unfortunately, annotation is limited to Windows users.

There is no Firefox ‚ÄúRecommended‚Äù badge on it. So, before deciding to use it, you can learn more about it on its add-on page.

## 9. Tomato Clock

![11 Useful Firefox Add-ons to Enhance Your Browsing Experience](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GsI8jRAZgusGulwFnJaRJMkLRTrMhnsFLzMrk0WilIDI-drGDDWc_ocv_V_TKZubQ84aPMAysDetWpIlxxG06K4N=w640-h400-e365-rj-sc0x00ffffff)

When you are browsing the internet, it‚Äôs important to keep an eye on your time, productivity, and sanity. especially if you fall into a rabbit hole while researching a subject. You should take a break, but you might become so engrossed that you don‚Äôt realise when it‚Äôs time.

As its name implies, the Tomato Clock add-on is exactly that. The timer is a clock. Depending on how engaged you are with the information on the screen, a ‚Äútomato‚Äù can feel either long or short at 25 minutes. You will receive a browser notification alerting you to the passing of time after 25 minutes have passed.

### Key Feature:

- The recommended extension by Mozilla.
- It has 300+ reviews, with an average rating of 4.5 stars.
- released source code under the GPL v3.0 License

## 10. Dictionary Anywhere

![11 Useful Firefox Add-ons to Enhance Your Browsing Experience](https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/209/209869.png?modified=1622133274)

### Key Feature:

- The recommended extension by Mozilla.
- average rating of 4.3 stars (with around 260 reviews).
- not consistently updated.

Having a handy dictionary is always a good idea! The macOS ‚Äúforce touch to look-up‚Äù feature has spoiled me. When I‚Äôm using Linux on my desktop, the Dictionary Anywhere add-on for Firefox makes up for it. Double-clicking a word brings up the definition with no additional effort required on my part!

The only languages currently supported are English, Spanish, German, and French. Please be aware that Firefox‚Äôs reader mode will NOT function with this extension. This is because scripts cannot be run in this mode.

This has the minor drawback of making ‚Äúdouble-clicking and selecting a whole word‚Äù in an editable text field a little annoying. Salvation is worth the small price.

Additionally, this will disappoint you if you want an extension that is actively maintained.

### Key Feature:

- With over 400 reviews, the average rating is 4.8 stars.
- Experiment plugin.

Do I need to explain this to you if you use Vim? Try it out for yourself now! Later on, you‚Äôll thank me.

For those who don‚Äôt know what this add-on does, it enables you to use only the Vim-style keys to navigate within Firefox. Several other keyboard shortcuts include pressing the J key to scroll down, the K key to scroll up, the X key to close the current tab, the T key to open a new tab, and more.

Although this add-on bears the label ‚ÄúExperimental,‚Äù I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues while using it over the past year or so.
