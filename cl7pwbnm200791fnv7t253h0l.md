You.com Is The Best Search Engine For Coders

[Bryan McCann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmarcusmccann/) and [Richard Socher](https://www.socher.org/) launched and created the search engine known as [You.com](http://You.com) or You search engine. It combines results from [Microsoft Bing](http://Bing.com) and specific websites, such as Reddit and many others. You.com is one way to access it, but it is not the only one. You can still access its services through the [You.com mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.you.browser&gl=US) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youcom/afiglppdonkdbkkaghbnpklddbemkbpj?authuser=0) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/you-com/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) extensions.

How Does It Differ from Google?
-------------------------------

You.com and Google are working for the same simple principle: searching for things on the Internet. However, they have some differences, apparently. What are those differences? Letâ€™s look at four of them.

Website Design and User Interface The first difference coming to mind is website design, obviously. You.com and Google have many different sides in terms of the webpage layout. Googleâ€™s search page has very simple and minimal-looking, while You.comâ€™s UI is more focused on coders and programmers.

Advanced Search Options
-----------------------

Both You.com and Google provide advanced search options. Actually, Googleâ€™s options are easier to use since you can narrow down the user search results as you want. That does not mean that You.comâ€™s advanced options are difficult to use, but you will not get any filtered results until pressing the video search, voice search, or image search button.

The Quality of the Results
--------------------------

When looking at the results, itâ€™s difficult to tell the difference between Google and You.com. However, there is a slight difference in your preferred viewpoint. If you need the most recent results for your research or need updated information, Google returns the most recent results, while You.com is less useful in this situation. On the other hand, it is sometimes useful not to arrange the result pages in chronological order. You may find the most relevant work for your search this way. You.comâ€™s decision engine is more likely to prioritize older videos and display the most relevant results for your search.

What Does It Do Better than Google?
-----------------------------------

You can add a lot more features to this list. Some of these were already mentioned, but now is the time to delve further.

### Ad-free

You.com does not show any ads in the search query like google and bing or any other search engine.

### Visual Search

When it comes to visual search, it is evident that You.com serves well. If you have a Coding or programming problem to be solved, you can search for it on You.com, and you can get the best result.

### Privacy

You.com does not track usersâ€™ information for ad targeting purposes or store their IP addresses. You.com offers two modes: the more private mode and the more public personal mode. You.com does not store user searches in private mode, share IP addresses with You.com partners, or gather any search-related data, in contrast to personal mode.

### Search For Coding problems

Here are the best comparison come when we search for code in Google vs You.com
