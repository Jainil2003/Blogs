In this blog, I have mentioned 5 of the most in-demand languages. Plus 5 honourable mentions.

In this blog, **you will find out why?**

There are thousands of options to choose from, but only the most popular programming languages are listed in this blog. All of them are valuable, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. To help you make an informed decision when choosing your next programming language, take a look at these top 5 programs that dominate the industry today.

1\. Javascript
--------------

There are 1.9 billion websites on the Internet today. And 95% of them use Javascript in some way or the other.

Other than simplicity, Javascript is also known for its speed and versatility. It can be used for the following programming projects:

Adding interactive elements to your website and creating web and mobile apps Build web servers Game development.

2\. HTML/CSS
------------

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a language that is used to give structure to the text and content on the web. Now HTML alone might not be able to do much on the appearance front. Thatâ€™s where Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) comes in.

While these languages are easy to learn, creating a modern-day website/application/program with just these two is tough.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used to manage and manipulate databases.

Developers use it to find and fetch data from a database. It is also used to add, update or remove records.

It also happens to be the third most- used programming language as 54.7% of developers reported using it.

5\. Java
--------

The star feature of Java is its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capability.

This general-purpose programming Language can thus, be used irrespective of the platform. From a business perspective, consider this. Your program written in Java can run as quickly on a supercomputer as a regular Android/iOS Smartphone.
