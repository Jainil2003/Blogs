**1) Define the following terms:**
----------------------------------

**(1) Biotic (2) Abiotic (3) Biosphere (4) Environment (5) Hydrosphere (6) Lithosphere (7) Environmental science (8) Environmental degradation**

**(3) Biosphere:**  Biosphere indicates the realm of living organisms (plant, animals, and microorganisms) and their interactions with the environment, viz. atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.

**(6) Lithosphere:** Lithosphere is the outer crust of solid earth. It consists of minerals occurring in the earth’s crust and the soil e.g., minerals, organic matter, air, and water.

**(5) Hydrosphere:**  A hydrosphere is the total amount of water on a planet. The hydrosphere includes water that is on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air.

**(4) Environment:**

“External surroundings and conditions which directly or indirectly affect the living organism. Is known as the “Environment”

The environment is divided into two parts…

**1) Biotic (Biological) Component**

Biotic or living components are the living components of the environment and include microbes, plants, animals, and human beings.

**2) Abiotic (Physical) Component**

Abiotic or non-living components of the environment include all the physical and chemical factors that influence living organisms. Examples of abiotic components are air, water, soil, rocks, etc.

**(7) Environment Science:**

“Environment Science is a scientific study of Earth, air, water, living organisms and man with its effect on the environment”

Or

“Environment Science is a scientific study of biotic and abiotic components and its effect on the environment”

**(8) Environmental degradation**

The deterioration of the environmental quality due to different activities of living beings that pollute key elements like air, water, and soil is called Environmental Degradation.

Environmental degradation can occur naturally or through human activities.

**2) Describe in detail the components of the environment. Also, discuss the interrelationship**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **between different components of the environment.**

The three components of the environment give rise to four important zones. These are the Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Lithosphere, and Biosphere. There is a continuous interaction among these four zones. These interactions involve the transport of various elements, compounds, and energy forms. These zones are explained as follows.

**(1)  Atmosphere:**

*   The atmosphere is a gaseous layer enveloping the Earth. The atmosphere with oxygen in abundance is unique to Earth and sustains life. It mainly comprises 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.038% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and noble gases. The amount of water vapour present is variable.

**(2) Hydrosphere:**

*   The hydrosphere comprises all forms of water bodies on earth including oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, etc. It covers 70% of the earth’s surface. 97.5% of water found on Earth is in the oceans in the form of salt water. Only 2.5 % of the water on Earth is freshwater. Out of this, 30.8% is available as groundwater and 68.9% is in frozen forms as in glaciers. An amount of 0.3% is available in rivers, reservoirs, and lakes and is easily accessible to man.
*   The hydrosphere is divided into two-part Freshwater and Marine water.
*   Fresh Water e.g., Rivers, Streams, lakes, ponds, etc.
*   Marine Water e.g., Oceans, Seas, Salty Lake, etc.

**(3) Lithosphere**

*   The lithosphere is the outermost layer of earth called the crust, which is made of different minerals. Its depth can reach up to 100 kilometres and is found on both land (terrestrial crust) and oceans (oceanic crust). The main component of the lithosphere is the earth’s tectonic plates.

**(4) Biosphere.**

*   The biosphere refers to all the regions on Earth where life exists. The ecosystems that support life could be in the soil, air, water, or land. The term Biosphere was coined by Geologist Edward Suess who used this term for places on Earth where life can be found. Biosphere refers to the total of all living matter, the biomass or biota. It extends from the polar ice caps to the equator, with each region harbouring some life form suitable to the conditions there.

The environment is divided into two parts

(1) Abiotic Component.

*   Atmosphere
*   Lithosphere
*   Hydrosphere

(2) Biotic Component.

*   Biosphere
*   The above figure shows a relationship between four environmental components.
*   Circles represent the sphere and curved arrows indicate the flow of matter from one sphere to another sphere.
*   All spheres have the two-way transfer of matter, one is within itself and another one is within other spheres.
*   All components of the environment are interrelated to each other; any change in one component may affect other components also.
*   E.g., a Change in the abiotic component like Temperature may raise a serious issue, the temperature change will raise the rate of evaporation and it will increase the humidity of the atmosphere.
*   And after the saturation( સંતૃપ્તા) of humidity rainfall take place, so directly or indirectly temperature changes are that going to affect the Lithosphere and ultimately to Biosphere. (In form of heavy rainfall and flood may raise the erosion on the earth’s surface.)
*   E.g., Lithosphere is almost a static component of the environment while the atmosphere and hydrosphere are dynamic components of the environment. Different types of movements in the air due to wind and storms and movements of river water as well as ocean water cause changes on the land surface and thus affect the lithosphere.
*   In the same way, each sphere is connected with a different sphere by various effects like precipitation, evaporation, photosynthesis, rock weathering, respiration, etc.

**3)****Explain the term “Environmental degradation”**
------------------------------------------------------

Definition:

The deterioration of the environmental quality due to different activities of living beings that pollute key elements like air, water, and soil is called Environmental Degradation.

Environmental degradation can occur naturally or through human activities.

The factors of environmental degradation are (1) Natural factors, and (2) Man-made factors.

**1\. Natural factors:**

*   Draughts.
*   Storms and floods.
*   Earthquakes.
*   Volcanic eruptions.
*   Tsunami etc.

**2\. Man-made factors:**

*   Urbanization.
*   Industrialization.
*   Deforestation etc.

The environment is degraded because of the following reasons.

1\. Overpopulation and poverty.

2\. Over uses of natural resources

3\. Wasteful use of natural resources.

4\. Deforestation.

5\. High use of fossil fuels like oil and coal.

6\. Heavy industrialization leads to air, water, and noise pollution.

7\. Heavy use of fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides

8\. Soil erosion.

**5)****Discuss the impacts of advanced technology on the degradation of the environment**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of Technology on Environment:

*   Because of the growth of technology and discoveries we are living in a modern world, with lots of facilities which are making our life comfortable,

e.g., medical, agriculture, transportation, construction, electronic equipment,  communication devices like mobile internet, etc.

*   Our development of technology is also producing a lot of problems for the environment. The impact of technology on the environment can be observed in many ways.
*   Here we have shown the effect of technology on various fields

**(1) Agriculture**

*   Soil erosion,
*   Eutrophication,
*   Heavy uses of pesticides, fertilizers, insecticides,
*   Water pollution
*   Stress on natural resources.

Define the following terms:
---------------------------

1.  Pollution 2.  Pollutant 3.  Water pollution 4.  Air Pollution 5.  Environmental

Pollution 6. Eutrophication 7. Noise Pollution 8. Solid waste management 9.  Biomedical waste 10.  E-waste  11.  Primary pollutant 12.  Secondary pollutants

13\. Waterborne disease   14. Pathogen

**1\. Pollution: –** Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants.

**2\. Pollutant: –** “Any substance present in the environment in harmful concentration which  can affect the quality of the environment is known as Pollutant “

**3\. Water Pollution: –**

*   “Water pollution is defined as Alteration in physical, chemical or biological characteristics of water through natural or human activities making it unusable”

Or

*   “Presence of some foreign substances or impurities (Organic, inorganic, biological, radiological) in such quantities that it lowers the quality of water is known as water pollution”

Or

*   ” Anything which degrades the quality of water is known as water pollution”

**4\. Air Pollution: –**

*   “Anything which degrades the quality of ambient air is known as Air Pollution”

OR

*   “Presence of unwanted and undesirable foreign particles and gases in the air which may have adverse effects on living beings and important structures is known as Air Pollution”

**5\. Environmental Pollution**

*   Environmental pollution is defined as “the contamination of the physical and biological components of the earth/atmosphere system to such an extent that normal environmental processes are adversely affected.

**6\. Eutrophication**

is the process in which a water body becomes overly enriched with nutrients, leading to the plentiful growth of simple plant life. The excessive growth (or bloom) of algae and plankton in a water body are indicators of this process. Eutrophication is considered to be a serious environmental concern since it often results in the deterioration of water quality and the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water bodies. Eutrophic waters can eventually become “dead zones” that are incapable of supporting life.

**7\. Noise Pollution**

*   Noise pollution or noise disturbance is the disturbing or excessive noise that may harm the activity or balance of Human or Animal Life.

**8\. Solid waste management: –**

*   The discipline is associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer and transport, processing, and disposal of solid waste in a manner that is following the best principles of public health, economics, engineering, conservation, aesthetics, and environmental consideration.

**9\. Biomedical Waste: –**

*   Waste is generated during the diagnosis, testing, treatment, research, or production of biological products for humans or animals.

**10\. E-Waste: –**

*   E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.

**11\. Primary Pollutants: –**

*   A primary pollutant is an air pollutant emitted directly from a source.

**12\. Secondary Pollutants: –**

*   A secondary pollutant is not directly emitted as such, but forms when other pollutants (primary pollutants) react in the atmosphere.

**13\. Waterborne Diseases: –**

*   Waterborne disease resembles diseases resulting from the contamination of food and can be caused by pathogens generally associated with foodborne transmission.

**14\. Pathogens: –**

*   Pathogens are organisms that can cause disease. The different types of pathogens and the severity of the diseases that they cause are very diverse.

Total wastes added to a water body is a sum of all point and nonpoint sources

**(1)   Point Sources**

*   Those sources which produce pollution and can be identified as a single location are known as point sources.
*   e.g., Industrial plants, power plants, sewage discharge, etc.
*   It’s possible to minimize the water pollution from the point sources because it is produced from limited locations.
*   Due to the rapid growth of the urban population, municipal and industrial zone are producing a higher level of pollution, sewage, and fertilizers Oil slippage, and various metals are producing bad effects.

**(2) Diffuse Sources of Nonpoint Sources**

*   Those sources which are producing pollution and cannot be identified from a single location are known as non-point sources of pollutants. These sources are scattered, so they are uncontrollable
*   E.g., small overflowing drains.

Surface runoff from agriculture fields. Air pollution degrades rainwater quality.

Small scattered and unauthorized industries Domestic level.

*   Agriculture is one example of this source, heavy uses of fertilizers and pesticides are mixed up with water, and it’s not in a limited area so the cumulative effect of it can damage more

2) Give the general classification of pollutants.
-------------------------------------------------

Depending upon their existence in nature.

**(a) Quantitative Pollutants:** They normally occur in the environment but acquire the status of a pollutant when their concentration increases due to unmindful human activities. E.g. carbon dioxide.

**(b) Qualitative Pollutants:** Do not naturally occur in the environment but are added by man e.g., Insecticides.

Depending upon the form in which they persist after being released into the atmosphere.

(a) Primary Pollutants: Those which are emitted from the source and persist in the form in which they were added to the environment e.g., ash, dust, hydrocarbon, etc.

(b) Secondary Pollutants: Those which are formed from primary pollutants. E.g., SO, ketones, aldehydes, PAN

6) Give a classification of water quality parameters and explain any two.

**1.  COLOUR**

*   Water is colourless in pure form, but impurities give a change in the colour of the water.
*   Organic matter (Woods, Weeds, leaves, etc.), Suspended Solids, and industrial wastes may change the colour of pure water
*   The sources of colour in water should always be investigated before the water is used
*   Accurate Measurement of colour can be done by a spectrophotometer

**1\. TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**

*   TDS is the Total Amount of mobile charged ions, including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in a given volume of water.
*   It’s expressed in units of mg per unit volume of water i.e. mg/l OR “ppm”
*   Dissolved solids refer to any minerals, salts, metals cations, or anions dissolved in water
*   TDS can be controlled by Reverse Osmosis (RO), Electrodialysis, and Carbon Filtration (Charcoal).
*   The desired value of TDS in India is approx. near to 500 ppm

7) Discuss adverse effects and control of water pollution.

(b) Air Pollution:
==================

3) Give the classification of Air Pollutants.
---------------------------------------------

Classification of Air Pollutants:

Air pollutants can be classified as under

*   Based on Origin
*   Based on the States of Matter

Classification based on the origin of pollutants

*   Depending upon the origin of pollutants, the air pollutants are classified as

1\. Primary air pollutants

2\. Secondary air pollutants

**1\. Primary Air Pollutants**

Pollutants which are directly emitted from the sources to the atmosphere are primary air Pollutants.

e.g.   Sulfur oxides (SOX)

Nitrogen oxide (NOX)

Carbon Monoxide

Radioactive materials

Particulate matter

Etc…..

**2\. Secondary Air Pollutants**

Pollutants are formed by chemical reactions among primary pollutants and atmospheric chemicals are known as Secondary Air Pollutants

e.g. Ozone, Sulfur Trioxide, Photochemical smog, Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) etc.…

**Classification based on the States of Matter**

Based on states of matter air is classified into two categories

(1) Gaseous air pollutants

(2) Particulate air pollutants

**(1)  Gaseous air pollutants**

Pollutant which is found in the gaseous state at normal temperature and pressure is called gaseous air pollutants

e.g., Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOX) Sulfur oxides (SOX), etc………

**(2) Particulate air pollutants**

Particulates are finely divided, airborne solid and liquid particles which remain for

the very long period in the air.

e.g., Aerosols, Dust, Smoke, mist, fog, haemoglobin, etc……..

4) Enumerate different primary and secondary air pollutants and explain the effect of carbon monoxide on human beings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The primary pollutants are “directly” emitted from the processes such as fossil fuel consumption, Volcanic eruption, and factories. The major primary pollutants are Oxides of Sulphur, Oxides of Nitrogen, Oxides of Carbon, Particulate Matter, Methane, Ammonia, Chlorofluorocarbons, Toxic metals, etc.
*   The secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. The secondary pollutants form when the primary pollutants react with themselves or other components of the atmosphere. The most important secondary level Air Pollutants are Ground Level Ozone, Smog, and POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants).

**Carbon monoxide: health effect**

*   CO combines with Fe in haemoglobin the blood -bonds 320 times stronger than oxygen – oxygen cannot bond onto haemoglobin
*   Less oxygen supplied to body cells
*   **Effects:**

headaches,

shortness of breath,

in case of high concentration (e.g., rush hour):

unconsciousness, death

8) Discuss the effects of common air pollutants on man, material, and vegetation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Effects On Humans**

*   People experience a wide range of health effects from being exposed to air pollution. Effects can be broken down into short-term effects and long-term effects.
*   Short-term effects, which are temporary, include illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis. They also include discomforts such as irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin. Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Bad smells made by factories, garbage, or sewer systems are considered air pollution, too. These odours are less serious but still unpleasant.
*   The long-term effects of air pollution can last for years or an entire lifetime. They can even lead to a person’s death. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people’s nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects. Nearly 2.5 million people die worldwide each year from the effects of outdoor or indoor air pollution.
*   People react differently to different types of air pollution. Young children and older adults, whose immune systems tend to be weaker, are often more sensitive to pollution. Conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and lung disease can be made worse by exposure to air pollution. The length of exposure and the amount and type of pollutants are also factors.

**Effect Of Air Pollution on Vegetation**

*   The effect of air pollution on vegetation is a serious issue these days. The impact of air pollution on plants and air pollutants negatively affects plant development, primarily through meddling with resource collection. Damage to leaf structure by air pollutants can be seen especially by O3 and NOx. Effects of Air Pollution on Plants cause deposition of contaminants in the soil, for example, heavy metals, which first influence the roots and meddle with soil assets catch by the plant. These decreases in asset catch will influence plant development through changes in asset portions to the different plant structures. The impact of air pollution on plants causes various stresses, for example, water pressure. The effect of air pollution on vegetation can cause severe damage to the plant network species in the present and also in the future.

**Effect of air pollution on materials.**

*   The effect of air pollution on materials may be seen in terms of **discolouration, material loss, structural failing, and soiling**. Both discolouration and structural failure due to air pollution on buildings may be insignificant and may not involve huge costs.

(C) Noise Pollution:
====================

2) Enlist major causes of noise pollution.
------------------------------------------

4) Explain the effects of noise on people and its control measures.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Noise pollution impacts millions of people daily. The most common health problem it causes is Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children. Many children who live near noisy airports or streets have been found to suffer from stress and other problems, such as impairments in memory, attention level, and reading skills.

Noise pollution can be effectively controlled by taking the following measures:

**(1) Control at Receiver’s End:**

For people working in noisy installations, ear-protection aids like ear-plugs, ear-muffs, noise helmets, headphones, etc. must be provided to reduce occupa­tional exposure.

**(2) Suppression of Noise at Source:**

This is possible if working methods are improved by:

(a) Designing, fabricating and using quieter machines to replace the noisy ones.

(b) Proper lubrication and better maintenance of machines.

(c) Installing noisy machines in soundproof chambers.

(d) Covering noise-producing machine parts with sound-absorbing materials to check noise production.

(e) Reducing the noise produced from a vibrating machine by vibration damp­ing i.e. making a layer of damping material (rubber, neoprene, cork, or plas­tic) beneath the machine.

(f) Using silencers to control noise from automobiles, ducts, exhausts, etc., and convey systems with ends opening into the atmosphere.

(g) Using glass wool or mineral wool covered with a sheet of perforated metal for mechanical protection.

**(3) Acoustic Zoning:**

Increased distance between source and receiver by the zoning of noisy industrial areas, bus terminals, railway stations, aerodromes, etc. away from the resi­dential areas would go a long way in minimizing noise pollution. There should be silence zones near the residential areas, educational institu­tions, and above all, near hospitals.

**(4) Sound Insulation at Construction Stages:**

(a) Sound travels through the cracks that get left between the door and the wall. For reducing noise, this space (jamb frame gap) should be packed with sound-absorbing material.

(b) Sound insulation can be done by constructing windows with double or triple panes of glass and filling the gaps with sound-absorbing materials.

(c) Acoustical tiles, hair felt, perforated plywood, etc. can be fixed on walls, ceil­ings, floors, etc. to reduce noise (especially for soundproof recording rooms, etc.)

**(5) Planting of Trees:**

Planting green trees and shrubs along roads, hospitals, educational institutions, etc. help in noise reduction to a considerable extent.

**(6) Legislative Measures:**

Strict legislative measures need to be enforced to curb the menace of noise pol­lution. Some of these measures could be:

(a) Minimum use of loudspeakers and amplifiers especially in near-silence zones.

(b) Banning pressure horns in automobiles.

(c) Framing a separate Noise Pollution Act.

Write a short note on
=====================

1) Solid Waste: Generation and management

**CAUSES OF SOLID WASTE POLLUTION:**

The main reasons for rapid growth in the number of solid wastes are:

1.  Over-population: As the number of people producing pollutant increase, pollution will naturally increase. The same is true for solid waste pollution too. Solid waste pollution increases with the increase in population.
2.  Technology: Rapidly growing technologies for most economic goods indicate a shift in technology from returnable packaging to non-returnable packaging. For example, returnable glass bottles/ containers are being replaced by non-returnable cans, plastic bottles, paper boards, and plastic containers. This will increase the solid waste solution.
3.  Urbanization: Solid waste is primarily an urban problem, though not exclusively urban. Solid waste pollution increases with increases in urbanization. For example, causes large metropolises such as Mumbai and Delhi generate around 9000 tons and 8300 tons of solid waste per day.
4.  Affluence: With the increase in affluence (i.e. increase in wealth and associated material comfort) there is a tendency to declare items as being in or out of fashion (or becoming obsolete) and promptly throw away the ones which are out of fashion. This results in solid waste pollution.

**SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT:**

Improper disposal of solid wastes leads to adverse environmental and health effects. The main objective of solid waste management is to minimize these adverse effects before it becomes too difficult to rectify in the future.

Solid waste management is a manifold task involving many activities/functions like:

1.  Collection of solid waste
2.  Processing of solid waste
3.  Disposal of solid waste

Source reduction can also be considered an element of solid waste management. Solid waste management may thus be defined as the application of techniques that will ensure the orderly execution of the functions of collection, processing, and disposal of solid waste. These functions/activities are called the three basic functional elements of solid waste management. All these three functions should be carried out in an economical manner consistent with the protection of public health.

2) Bio-medical Waste: Generation and management

**GENERATION OF BIO-MEDICAL WASTE:**

The generation rate of bio-medical waste depends on:

Number, kind, and size of the departments in the health care facility (i.e. Hospitals)

Number of beds patients admitted

Types of specialities of the hospital

Reusable items employed in delivering healthcare services

Level of instrumentation

Medical waste segregation system adopted.

Local legislations

Established waste management system. For the development of a proper waste management system, reliable data for the generation of biomedical data should be available. In India, only a few medical facilities have carried out proper quantification of generated Generally developed countries have a generation rate of 1-5 kg/bed/day while that of the developing countries is around 1-2 kg/bed/day.

#### The table gives the average bio-medical generation rate based on the available literature

The approximate number of beds in the health care sector (Government) in India is 710761 as per the National Health Profile (NHP) of India 2018. If we consider the minimum generation rate of 0.25 kg/bed/day, then the total estimated quantity of biomedical waste generated would be 710761 x 0.25- 199013 kg or approximately 199 tons/day. This is the quantity generated by only the government sector, quantity generated by the private hospitals has to be added which would further increase the total quantity of waste generated. As per CPCB data about 3 million tons of biomedical waste, I generated per year in India with a growth rate of 8%. Therefore, a proper management system should be in place to handle this large quantity of waste generated.

**MANAGEMENT OF BIOMEDICAL WASTE:**

Bio-medical waste is potentially hazardous, the main hazard being infection, and may pose a serious threat to human health if its management is indiscriminate and unscientific. The main functional elements are:

(1) Segregation and storage

(2) Transportation to the “treatment facilities

(3) Treatment

3) E-waste: Generation and management

**GENERATION OF E-WASTE:**

According to The Global E-waste Monitor, a report published by the United Nations University, the International Telecommunication Union, and the International Solid Waste Association, humanity generated 44.7 million metric tons of e-waste in 2016, which is equivalent to 6.1 kilograms per person. Figure 7.1 gives the details of the e-waste generated by the top 10 countries which are among the top10 generators of e-waste. India is the fourth-largest producer of e-waste in the world. India produces about 2 million tons of e-waste in 2016 at the rate of 1.5 kg/capita. Per capita generation numbers do not give an exact picture as the population of each country is different.

**Responsibilities of the Government**

(I) Governments should set up regulatory agencies in each district, which are vested with the responsibility of coordinating and consolidating the regulatory functions of the various government authorities regarding hazardous substances.

(ii) Governments should be responsible for providing an adequate system of laws, controls, and administrative procedures for hazardous waste management (Third World Network. 1991). Existing laws concerning e-waste disposal are reviewed and revamped. A comprehensive law that provides e-waste regulation and management and proper disposal of hazardous wastes is required. Such a law should empower the agency to control, supervise and regulate the relevant activities of government departments.

**Responsibility and Role industries**

Generators of wastes should take responsibility to determine the output characteristics of wastes and if hazardous, should provide management options. All personnel involved in handling e-waste in industries including those at the policy, management, control, and operational levels, should be properly qualified and trained. Companies can adopt their policies while handling

Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers should undertake the responsibility of recycling/disposal of their products

**Responsibilities of the Citizen**

Waste prevention is perhaps more preferred than any other waste management option including recycling. Donating electronics for reuse extends the lives of valuable products and keeps them out of the waste management system for a longer time. But care should be taken while donating such items i.e. the items should be in working condition Reuse, in addition to being an environmentally preferable alternative, also benefits society. By donating used electronics, schools, non-profit organizations, and lower-income families can afford to use equipment that they otherwise could not afford. E-waste should never be disposed of with garbage and other household wastes. This should be segregated at, the site and sold or donated to various organizations

UNIT 3: GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
===================================

Define the following terms:
===========================

1\. Sustainable Development 2. Climate Change 3. Global warming 4. Acid rain 5. Ozone layer depletion 6. Carbon footprint 7. Cleaner Development Mechanism

**1\. Sustainable development: –**

*   Sustainable development is defined as “a constraint upon present consumption to ensure that future generations will inherit a resource base that is no less than the inheritance of the previous generation.”

**2\. Climate Change: –**

*   Climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns. Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global temperatures from the mid-20th century to the present.

**3\. Global Warming: –**

*   Rise in the average temperature of the Earth’s surface (mainly air T).
*   From the Environmental Science point of view, the continuous increase in the air temperature due to air pollutants, mostly so-called greenhouse gases

**4.  Acid rain**

*   Acid rain is rain that has a higher-than-normal acid level (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure.

**5\. Ozone layer depletion**

*   Ozone Depletion. When **chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in** the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created.

**6\. Carbon footprint**

*   Carbon Footprint (CF) is a method used to quantify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with a company (Corporate Carbon Footprint, CCF) or with the life cycle of an activity or a product/service (Product Carbon Footprint, PCF) to, determine its contribution to climate change.

**7\. Cleaner Development Mechanism**

*   CDM allows industrialized countries to invest in emission–reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reductions which can be traded and used by industrialized countries to achieve part of their reduction targets.

3) What is global warming? Enlist its causes, effects, and control measures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is Global Warming?**

*   Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earth’s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial but scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.
*   There are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants, and animals. These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities. To curb the issues, it is very important to understand the negative impacts of global warming.

6) What is Acid Rain? Write causes and effects and control of acid rain on the environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Causes of acid rain**

*   When Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen oxide (N0) These chemicals are released from power plants and factories. They react with the water in the air and form acids.

,

**Effects of acid rain**

*   Damages trees and other plants
*   Can destroy ponds and other bodies of water killing the fish and other aquatic life.
*   Damages houses and other buildings, including monuments and statues.

**Solution Of Acid Rain**

*   Fit scrubbers into factory chimneys, which are chemical filters that remove impurities such as sulfur from smoke
*   Cars can be fitted with special converters which remove dangerous chemicals
*   Governments need to spend more money on pollution control.
*   Governments need to invest in researching different ways to produce energy.

7) What is ozone? How is it formed? Describe the main causes of depletion of the ozone layer and briefly comment on control measures taken to prevent further ozone depletion at the international level.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What Is Ozone? How is it formed?**

*   Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms, often referenced as O3. Ozone is formed when heat and sunlight cause chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), which are also known as Hydrocarbons. This reaction can occur both near the ground and high in the atmosphere.

**Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion**

*   The ozone layer depletion is a major concern and is associated with many factors. The main causes responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer are listed below:
*   Chlorofluorocarbons

Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are the main cause of ozone layer depletion. These are released by solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, air-conditioners, etc.

The molecules of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere are broken down by ultraviolet radiations and release chlorine atoms. These atoms react with ozone and destroy it.

*   Unregulated Rocket Launches

Researchers say that the unregulated launching of rockets results in much more depletion of the ozone layer than the CFCs do. If not controlled, this might result in a huge loss of the ozone layer by the year 2050.

*   Nitrogenous Compounds

The nitrogenous compounds such as NO2, NO, and N2O are highly responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.

*   Natural Causes

The ozone layer is depleted by certain natural processes such as Sun-spots and stratospheric winds. But it does not cause more than 1-2% of the ozone layer depletion.

*   Volcanic eruptions are also responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.

**Solutions to Ozone Layer Depletion**

*   The depletion of the ozone layer is a serious issue and various programs have been launched by the government of various countries to prevent it. However, steps should be taken at the individual level as well to prevent the depletion of the ozone layer.
*   Following are some points that would help in preventing this problem at a global level:
*   Avoid Using ODS

Reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances. E.g., avoid the use of CFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners, replace the halon-based fire extinguishers, etc.

*   Minimize the Use of Vehicles

The vehicles emit a large number of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming as well as ozone depletion. Therefore, the use of vehicles should be minimized as much as possible.

*   Use Eco-friendly Cleaning Products

Most cleaning products have chlorine and bromine-releasing chemicals that find their way into the atmosphere and affect the ozone layer. These should be substituted with natural products to protect the environment.

*   Use of Nitrous Oxide should be Prohibited

The government should take action and prohibit the use of harmful nitrous oxide that is adversely affecting the ozone layer. People should be made aware of the harmful effects of nitrous oxide and the products emitting the gas so that its use is minimized at the individual level as well.

2) Discuss the Objectives and Fundamental Principles of Green Building
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives of a Green Building

*   Protecting occupant health,
*   Improving employee productivity,
*   Using energy, water and other resources more efficiently,
*   Reducing overall impact on the environment,
*   Optimal environmental and economic performance,
*   Satisfying and quality indoor spaces.

Fundamental Principles Of A Green Building

*   The building should be water efficient.
*   The building should be energy efficient.
*   The amount of waste and pollution emitted from the building should be reduced.
*   Materials used in making the building should work efficiently towards the basic objectives of the “green building”.

5) Discuss the Smart Cities
---------------------------

A city that uses digital communication technologies and big data to improve operational efficiency and the quality of life for residents.

UNIT 5: CONCEPT OF 4R’s
=======================

1) Describe the Principles and Application of 4R’s
--------------------------------------------------

The 4R’s in principle refer to the four words starting with the alphabet R. They are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover.

Let us discuss in brief, what each of these words means in today’s world.

The 4R means Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Restore.

(i) Reduce: We should reduce the use of non-biodegradable compounds that are harmful to us.

Example: Instead of using polythene bags we should give preference to paper bags.

(ii) Reuse: We should reuse the materials instead of dumping them.

Example: Plastic bags can be reused to make decorative things.

(iii) Recycle: Non-biodegradable materials should be subjected to the recycling process.

Example: Plastic materials.

(iv) Recovery: If the waste remains after it is been reused and recycled, we can use it to generate energy at our waste-energy plant. This is known as Recovery.

*   Warning I googled all answers if you have any doubt then ask the faculty or try your research.
*   I used sites like- [**National Geographic**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/), Many gov sites, NASA research on global warming, etc.…
*   **Please forgive me if there is any grammatical problem** 😔
*   **(And please comment if there are any problems.)**
*   I marked it orange, which means I don’t know what it is.
