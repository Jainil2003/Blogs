# The Most Beautiful Linux Distributions for 2022

There is a Linux distribution for every user, regardless of their preferences or what they want to use it for.

Getting started with Linux? You can choose beginner-friendly Linux distributions. Are you leaving Windows? There are Linux distributions that resemble Windows. own a dated computer? Lightweight Linux distributions are an option.

Iâ€™m only going to highlight the prettiest Linux distributions in this list.

## The Top 12 Most Stunning Linux Distributions
Wait! Is there such a thing as a lovely Linux distribution? Isnâ€™t it redundant, given that you can customise the appearance of any distribution and make it look better with themes and icons?

You are correct in this regard. However, we will concentrate on distributions that look great without any tweaking or customization from the user. These distributions offer a smooth, pleasant desktop experience right out of the box.

Please keep in mind that the list is not ranked in any particular order.
## 1. Zorin OS

Zorin OS is a lovely Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. After installing it, the user interface should make both Windows and macOS users feel at ease. In fact, I think itâ€™s a fantastic modern alternative to Windows 10.

They also provide a lite edition of their operating system if your system has a slightly underpowered hardware configuration. You can also read our impressions of Zorin OS lite to learn more about it.

It looks and feels fantastic, and it has a short learning curve. To begin, if you want to get the most out of Zorin OS while having all of the necessary software tools bundled, you can purchase the Zorin OS ultimate edition.

## 2. Deepin

Deepin is yet another lovely Linux distribution based on Debianâ€™s stable branch. The animations (look and feel) may be too much for some, but it looks nice.

It includes the Deepin Desktop Environment, which includes a variety of essential features for the best possible user experience. It may not look exactly like the UI of any other distribution, but itâ€™s simple to get used to. Deepin Linux comes with a number of pre-installed tools that should be useful and blend in with the desktop environment.

My personal focus would be on the control panel and the colour scheme. If you donâ€™t trust the distribution but still want to use the desktop environment, UbuntuDDE is an option.

**Note:** This OS Comes From China.

## 3. CutefishOS

![E8jfbzhUcAUeMzB?format=jpg&name=large - Jainil Prajapati](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E8jfbzhUcAUeMzB?format=jpg&name=large)

CutefishOS is a relatively new Linux distribution that is still in beta at the time of writing.

However, it approaches the user interface with great care and simplicity, making it one of the most visually appealing Linux distributions available. Our first impression of CutefishOS was that it could dethrone Deepin as one of the most appealing distros.

This should not be used on a production-ready desktop. It is currently intended for testing, so if youâ€™re looking for an adventure, give it a shot.

**Note:** This Project Is Discontinued

## 4. Garuda Linux

![garuda dr460nized - Jainil Prajapati](https://garudalinux.org/images/garuda/download/dr460nized/garuda-dr460nized.webp)

Another Arch-based distribution to add to the list. This is relatively new, but it provides an impressive experience right out of the gate.

It comes with both KDE and GNOME desktop environment editions, as well as a number of spins with different tiling window managers.

To learn more about the Garuda, read our Garuda review or watch the video above.

**Proudly Saying this OS Comes From My country India** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

## 5. Feren OS

Feren OS is an Ubuntu-based distribution that includes the KDE desktop. It has a simple and functional user interface.

Feren OS does not have a lot going on, but if you want a simple and unique KDE experience, it can be a good-looking option.

## 6. Pop!\_OS

![menu - Jainil Prajapati](https://www.xtremerigs.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/menu.png)

Pop! OS manages to provide a great user interface on top of Ubuntu while also providing a near-vanilla GNOME experience.

It is also my personal favourite, and I use it as my primary desktop operating system. Pop! OS isnâ€™t flashy, and it doesnâ€™t have any fancy animations. However, theyâ€™ve gotten it right by having a perfect combination of icons/themesâ€”while also polishing the user experience from a technical standpoint.

This may improve with the introduction of their new COSMIC desktop environment.

I donâ€™t want to start a debate between Ubuntu and Pop! OS, but if youâ€™re used to Ubuntu, Pop! OS can be a great alternative for a potentially better user experience.

## 7. Manjaro Linux

![Manjaro 20.2 screenshot - Jainil Prajapati](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Manjaro_20.2_screenshot.png)

An Arch-based Linux distribution is Manjaro Linux. While installing Arch Linux can be a little challenging, Manjaro offers a simpler and more streamlined Arch experience.

It provides a selection of desktop environment editions for you to download. You still have enough options, regardless of what you select, to alter the layout or the look and feel.

You can give it a try, but in my opinion, it appears to be quite fantastic for an Arch-based distribution that functions right out of the box!

## 8. KDE Neon

![kdeneon1 - Jainil Prajapati](https://i0.wp.com/9to5linux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kdeneon1.jpg?fit=1920%2C1004&ssl=1)

KDE Neon is available for users who prefer a simpler approach to the design language while still receiving an excellent user experience.

Based on Ubuntu, it is an intriguing Linux distribution that puts an emphasis on providing the most recent KDE packages. If you want the most recent KDE features, your only choice is KDE Neon, even though it might not be the best desktop operating system for you.

In contrast to Kubuntu or other KDE-based distributions, you donâ€™t have to wait months to get the most recent KDE software.

Feel free to experiment with the KDE desktop since it has a tonne of built-in customization features!

## 9. elementary OS

![desktop - Jainil Prajapati](https://elementary.io/images/screenshots/desktop.jpg)

One of the most attractive Linux distributions available in elementary OS. While offering a fantastic user experience for Linux users, it leans toward a macOS-like appearance. You wonâ€™t have any trouble using the elementary OS if you are already accustomed to using macOS.

Additionally, because the elementary OS is based on Ubuntu, itâ€™s simple to find a tonne of applications to get things done.

Beyond just the appearance, the elementary OS is constantly working to make significant changes. As a result, you can anticipate that each update will enhance your user experience.

## 10. Nitrux OS

![Screenshot 20220129 174533 - Jainil Prajapati](https://nxos.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot_20220129_174533.png)

A Debian-based Linux distribution with a distinctive approach is called Nitrux OS. Originally built on Ubuntu, Nitrux abandoned Ubuntu as the foundation.

It focuses on giving users who want a distinctive design language and a new perspective on a Linux distro a positive user experience. It makes use of the KDE-based Nomad desktop.

Nitrux promotes the use of AppImage for application development. But Nitrux also supports the Pacman package manager from Arch Linux. Wonderful, isnâ€™t it?

Even though itâ€™s not the ideal OS for everyone, it sure does look nice and is adequate for the majority of basic tasks. You can learn more about it by reading our interview with the founder of Nitrux.

## 11. Linux Mint

With rounded corners, Linux Mint has been making improvements to its user interface and overall appearance.

Although the updated themes and icons look great right out of the box, the classic themes are still available. It may not be as visually appealing as some of the other choices on this list, but it offers a respectable level of simplicity and a contemporary desktop environment.

Additionally, Linux Mint outperforms Ubuntu in a few areas, making it a viable desktop operating system depending on your needs.

## 12. Solus Budgie

![1*vL8qwU7tBawlpbwPNoIDww - Jainil Prajapati](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vL8qwU7tBawlpbwPNoIDww.jpeg)

Want a Linux distribution that isnâ€™t based on Ubuntu or Arch? You should have a revitalising user experience using Solus and its original Budgie desktop.

It offers a clear and comfortable user interface and accepts queues from various other desktop environments. Other desktop editions are also available, but the Budgie desktop edition ought to be distinguished from the rest.
